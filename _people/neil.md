I have been a Senior Research scientist at DeepMind for five years, using game theory, online learning and search to make agents for complex, multiagent environments.
The algorithms I design are motivated by theoretical guarantees, and the ability to scale to real world problems.
Non-stationary and multiagent environments are exciting to me because when I think about intelligent agents, I think about the ability to adapt to changes and reason about decisions with imperfect information about what other agents know.
My recent publications have mostly been on search-like methods for imperfect information environments, and my current lines of research are continuing that work, and looking at online learning in continuing environments.
I am currently co-supervising an MSc graduate student at the University of Alberta, looking at online learning and tracking regret.
